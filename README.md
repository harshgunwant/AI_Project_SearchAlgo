# AI_Project_SearchAlgo
Note: The code for this project (CS 205) is in the AI_ProjectFinal1 and NOT in production.
Here I have solved 8 piece puzzle using 3 Algorithms: 
1. Uniform cost search 
2. A* with misplaced tile heuristic 
3. A* with the Euclidean distance heuristic.

I have watched few youtube videos and blogs for my reference. The links are provided below:

4. A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic (https://youtu.be/oAye4hI_sis)
5. A* with the Euclidean Distance heuristic (https://youtube.com/shorts/N0FNwaJ7htA?feature=share) 
6. A* with Euclidean and Manhattan comparison. (https://youtu.be/YooweZVcNpE)

Note: The .ipynb file corresponds to the graphs that were plotted. 

Note: Additionally I have also tried making it more real (that is giving it a GUI) using JavaFX. Tried implementing it in the PuzzleSolverGUI.java file.This will be in progress...
